    "Kenya’s economic stability is intrinsically linked to the performance of its agricultural sector, which serves as both a primary GDP contributor and the backbone of livelihoods for millions of households. However, the sector continues to face structural inefficiencies characterized by persistent price volatility, fragmented market coordination, information asymmetry, and sentiment-driven demand fluctuations. These systemic challenges erode income predictability for farmers and traders, constrain value chain optimization, and ultimately weaken overall market resilience. In a data-driven global economy, the absence of real-time market intelligence and forward-looking analytics represents a critical strategic gap. Addressing this gap through an integrated, predictive market insights and forecasting system presents a transformative opportunity to enhance transparency, stabilize incomes, strengthen decision-making, and drive sustainable economic impact across Kenya’s agricultural ecosystem.\n",

    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Kenya’s agricultural markets exhibit pronounced price volatility across regions and commodity categories, creating significant uncertainty for market participants. These fluctuations are driven by seasonal production cycles, shifting demand patterns, regional supply imbalances, and evolving public perception. For example, staple commodities such as maize experience substantial temporal and geographic price disparities, directly influencing farmers’ commercialization strategies and revenue outcomes. Compounding these structural inefficiencies is the growing influence of digital public sentiment, particularly on social media platforms, which increasingly shapes market expectations and short-term demand behavior. The convergence of these factors results in a complex and opaque decision-making environment, limiting stakeholders’ ability to optimize pricing, distribution, and market timing strategies.\n",
